- Calculate a **Kaplan-Meier survival curve.**
- Compare the survival rates of two groups with the **log-rank test.**
- Model survival data using **Cox's proportional hazards**

## What is survival data?


Time-to-event data that consist of a distinct start time and end time

Examples:

- Time from surgery to death

- Time for customer to cancel a subscription (churn)

- Time to machine malfunction

Survival analysis is common in many other fields, such as:

- Reliability analysis

- Duration analysis

- Event history analysis

- Time-to-event analysis

## Censored Data


![Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/statisticsmemes/comments/u21swt/what_i_learned_in_survival_analysis_so_far/](images/survival_analysis_meme.jpg)

![Source (slightly modified): https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-survival-analysis-6f7e19c31d96](images/time_to_event2.png)


Observations are __censored__ when the information about their survival time is incomplete.

Examples:

- Loss to follow-up

- Withdrawal from study (line 5)

- No event/outcome by end of fixed study period (line 3 and 2)

These are examples of **right** censoring.

Left censoring and interval censoring are also possible, but the most frequent is right censoring.


## Lab: Brain Cancer survival analysis

Rather then do the lab at the end, let's try a different approach and thread the Brain Cancer lab  through the chapter discussion.

- Hopefully this helps illustrate the main points of the text with examples worked out in R. 

- `BrainCancer` data set:

```{r 11dataset}
data("BrainCancer")
dim(BrainCancer)
head(BrainCancer)
```

```{r 11count}
BrainCancer %>% 
     count(status)
```


 - Note: `status` = 1 indicates uncensored, which is the convention for `R`.
 
 - For `BrainCancer` data set $35$ patients died before the end of the study (uncensored)


## Survival Function

$$
S(t) = Pr(T>t)
$$

- $T$ is the time of 'death' or other event under consideration.

- $S(t)$ is the probability of surviving up to time $t$.  

- But we dont observe $T$  !  Rather we observe $Y$:

$$ Y = min(T,C)$$

where C is the time of censoring.  We also need to observe a status indicator:

$$ \delta = 
             \left\{ \begin{array}{c l}
                1, & \text{if } T \leq C \\
                0, & \text{if } T > C
            \end{array} \right.
$$

 - These pairs $(y_n, \delta_n)$ represent the survival data. (In R, they are combined to make a survival object using `Surv`)
 

## Kaplan-Meier survival curve

- We don't have $T$ so cannot just count up how many are alive at any given point in the study to estimate $S(t)$.

- Define:
    
    - $d_j$ : the times of death.

    - $r_j$: the number of non-censored 'alive' cases at time $d_j$.  (at risk)
    
    - $q_j$:  the number that die at time $d_j$ (typically just 1!)
    
- The ratio $(r_j - q_j)/r_j$ is the fraction of those at risk that survive past time $d_k$

- This fraction is an estimate of the probabilty $Pr(T> d_j | T> d_{j-1})$  

> Note that this uses only uncensored data at time $d_i$ but includes data that could become censored later! It takes care of censoring 'automatically'.
 
- The text shows how one can decompose $S(d_k)$ into these more elemental probabilities:

$$
S(d_k) = Pr(T> d_k | T> d_{k-1}) \times ... \times Pr(T > d_2 | T > d_1)Pr(T> d_1)
$$

- This leads to the Kaplan-Meier estimator:

$$
\hat{S}(d_k) = \Pi_{j=1}^{k} (\frac{r_j- q_j}{r_j})
$$

- Note also that:

$$
\ln\hat{S}(d_k) = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \ln (\frac{r_j- q_j}{r_j})
$$



## Kaplan-Meier survival curve in R

- K-M curves can be computed using the `survfit()` function within the `R` `survival` library. Here `time` corresponds to $y_i$, the time to the $i$th event (either censoring or death).

```{r 11plot_KM_curve}
fit.surv <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = BrainCancer)
plot(fit.surv, xlab = "Months",
    ylab = "Estimated Probability of Survival")
```

## KM curve stratified by sex

Next we create Kaplan-Meier survival curves that are stratified by `sex`, in order to reproduce Figure 11.3.

```{r 11KM_curve_sex}
fit.sex <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = BrainCancer)
plot(fit.sex, xlab = "Months",
    ylab = "Estimated Probability of Survival", col = c(2,4))
legend("bottomleft", levels(BrainCancer$sex), col = c(2,4), lty = 1)
```

## Log-Rank test

As discussed in the book, Section 11.4, we can perform a log-rank test to compare the survival of males to females, using the `survdiff()` function.

> See also Exercise 7 to go into depth on this!

```{r 11logrank_test}
logrank.test <- survdiff(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = BrainCancer)
logrank.test
```

The resulting $p$-value is $0.23$, indicating  no evidence of a difference in survival between the two sexes.


## Survminer package

Survminer is a package that draws survival curves using ggplot, and can provide logrank p-values all in one go!

Using `survminer` package
```{r 11survminer, message=FALSE}
library(survminer)
ggsurvplot(fit.sex, data = BrainCancer, 
           pval = TRUE,
           conf.int = TRUE, 
           risk.table = TRUE, 
           legend.title = "Sex", 
           legend.labs = c("Female", "Male"))
```



## Hazard Function

- The hazard function is the risk of having an event given you survived up to time *t*.

$$h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}  \frac{ Pr(t+ \Delta t \geq T > t | T > t)}{\Delta t}$$

>Why do we care about the hazard function? It turns out that a key approach for modeling survival data as a function of covariates (i.e., regressors) relies heavily on the hazard function.

### How is the hazard rate related to the survival probability? 

Define the event ('death') rate:

$$f(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\frac{ Pr(t+ \Delta t \geq T > t)}{\Delta t}$$

- $f(t)\Delta t$ is the probability of the event occurring near t, not conditioned like $h$.
 

- the probability of an event near (i.e. within $\Delta t$) time $t$ should be equal to the probability of surviving until time $t$ multiplied by the probability of an event near time $t$ *given* that you have survived until time $t$. That is:

$$
f(t)  = h(t)S(t)
$$

>The book gives a more rigorous derivation using Baye's rule, but this an intuitive way to get there.   

Now consider that if $S(t)$ is the survival probability, then $1-S(t)$ is the probability of the event occurring by time t. And intuitively we would expect that $1-S(t) = \int_{0}^{t}f(u)du$, i.e. the probability of the event occuring by time t is just the sum of the probabilities of all the times the event could have occurred. 


Verification:

> Note the following is basically Excercise 8.  Skip it if you have not done this yet!

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d S}{d t} &= lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{S(t+dt) - S(t)}{\Delta t} \\
& = lim_{\Delta t \to 0}  \frac{Pr(T>t+\Delta t) - Pr(T > t)}{\Delta t}\\
& = lim_{\Delta t \to 0}  \frac{Pr(T>t+\Delta t) - (Pr(T > t + \Delta t) + Pr(t+ \Delta t \geq T > t))}{\Delta t} \\
& = lim_{\Delta t \to 0}  \frac{- Pr(t+ \Delta t \geq T > t)}{\Delta t} \\
& = - f(t)   
\end{align}
$$



 
- So we have finally:

$$
\frac{d S}{d t} = - S(t)h(t)\\
\text{or}\\
\frac{d \text{ ln} S}{d t} = -h(t)
$$


- log of the survival probability is the negative of the 'cumulative' hazard ($\int{h(t) dt}$)

$$
\ln S =  -\int{h(t) dt} 
$$

 
> Note that this construction is similar to that of the Kaplan-Meier curve $\ln\hat{S}(d_k) = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \ln (\frac{r_j- q_j}{r_j}) \approx \sum_{j=1}^{k} (-q_j/r_j)$ where $q_i/r_j$ is the hazard at time $q_i$ 
 

*Example:* consider a constant hazard (e.g. radioactive decay) $h=\lambda$ (i.e. at any moment, the chance of an event is constant given no event up to that moment).  In that case the survival is exponential, as we expect,  $S(t) = \exp(-\lambda t)$ and $f(t) = \lambda \exp(-\lambda t)$ . 


## Regression models

* The hazard function can be used to specify a likelihood (for maximum likelihood methods)

$$
L = \prod_{i=1}^{n}h(y_i)^{\delta_i}S(y_i)
$$

* For a non-censored data point, the factor is $h(y_i)S(y_i) = f(y_i)$ , the probability of dying in an tiny interval around $y_i$ 

* For a censored data point, the factor is just $S(y_i)$, the probability of surviving at *least* until $y_i$.

* This could  be used for some parameterized model of $h$, Exercise 9 looks at this for a simple (constant hazard) example.

* But we really want to do regression, and one approach is to assume functional form like 
$h(t|x_i) = exp \left(\beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{p}\beta_j x_{ij}\right)$.  This could be used in the likelihood to estimate the parameters, but the lack of time dependence is very restrictive.


## Proportional Hazards

The *proportional hazards assumption* states that (ISLR2 11.14):

$$
h(t|x_i)= h_0(t) \exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^{p}x_{ij}\beta_k\right)
$$

*Assumes* separate time dependence (baseline hazard $h_0$) from feature dependence.


- Important to check proportional assumption!

    - Qualitative feature: plot the log hazard function for each level of the feature
    
    - Quantitative feature: stratify (`cut`) the feature and do the above.

![Source ISLR Fig 11.4](images/fig11_4.png)


## Cox Proportional Hazards Model


- Because $h_0(t)$ is unknown we cannot just plug $h(t|x_i)$ into the likelihood function and apply maximum likelihood

- **Cox proportionalhazards model (Cox, 1972)** estimates $\beta$ without having to specify the form of $h_0(t)$ by using a partial (relative) likelihood where $h_0(t)$ cancels out. (Details in text)


Let's fit the Cox proportional hazards models using the `coxph()`  function.
To begin, we consider a model that uses `sex` as the only predictor.
```{r 11coxph}
fit.cox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = BrainCancer)
summary(fit.cox)
```

Regardless of which test we use, we see that there is no clear evidence for a difference in survival between males and females.


Now we fit a  model that makes use of additional predictors. 

```{r 11chunk10}
fit.all <- coxph(
Surv(time, status) ~ sex + diagnosis + loc + ki + gtv +
   stereo, data = BrainCancer)
fit.all
```

- The `diagnosis` variable has been coded so that the baseline corresponds to meningioma.

- Results indicate that the risk associated with HG glioma is more than eight times (i.e. $e^{2.15}=8.62$) the risk associated with meningioma. In other words, after adjusting for the other predictors, patients with HG glioma have much worse survival compared to those with meningioma.  

- In addition, larger values of the Karnofsky index, ki, are associated with lower risk, i.e. longer survival.

## Surivival Curves

- Possible to plot (estimated) survival curves for each diagnosis category,  adjusting for the other predictors.

- To make these plots, set the values of the other predictors equal to the mean for quantitative variables, and the modal value for factors. 

```{r 11chunk11}
with(BrainCancer,{
  modaldata <- data.frame(
       diagnosis = levels(diagnosis),
       sex = rep("Female", 4),
       loc = rep("Supratentorial", 4),
       ki = rep(mean(ki), 4),
       gtv = rep(mean(gtv), 4),
       stereo = rep("SRT", 4)
       )
  survplots <- survfit(fit.all, newdata = modaldata)
  plot(survplots, xlab = "Months",
      ylab = "Survival Probability", col = 2:5)
  legend("bottomleft", levels(diagnosis), col = 2:5, lty = 1)
})
```

>The book says that the methods used to estimate $h_0(t)$ are beyond the scope of the book. Documentation for  `survfit.coxph` mentions a 'Breslow estimator' which seems to be similar to Kaplan-Meier... something for future study!
