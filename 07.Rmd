# Moving Beyond Linearity

**Learning objectives:**

- Use **polynomial regression** to model a relationship between a predictor and an outcome.
- Use **step functions** to model a relationship between a predictor and an outcome.
- Use **regression splines** to model a relationship between a predictor and an outcome.
- Use **smoothing splines** to model a relationship between a predictor and an outcome.
- Use **local regression** to model a relationship between a predictor and an outcome.
- Use **generalized additive models** to model a relationship between multiple predictors and an outcome.


## Slide 1

- Try to follow a slide-like format.

## Slide 2

- Use `##` to create new slides (sections).

00:51:58	Jon Harmon (jonthegeek):	Because I'm obsessed now with "Why Œæ?":
"KS" for "knot/spline" = "ks" = "Œæ"?
I'm going to try to use that now, at least üôÉ
