# Moving Beyond Linearity

**Learning objectives:**

- Use **polynomial regression** to model a relationship between a predictor and an outcome.
- Use **step functions** to model a relationship between a predictor and an outcome.
- Use **regression splines** to model a relationship between a predictor and an outcome.
- Use **smoothing splines** to model a relationship between a predictor and an outcome.
- Use **local regression** to model a relationship between a predictor and an outcome.
- Use **generalized additive models** to model a relationship between multiple predictors and an outcome.
