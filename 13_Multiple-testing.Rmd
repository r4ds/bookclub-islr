# Multiple Testing

**Learning objectives:**

- Identify the challenges of performing **multiple hypothesis tests.**
- Reduce Type I errors by controlling the **family-wise error rate** (FWER).
- Balance Type I and Type II errors by controlling the **false discovery rate** (FDR).
- Calculate p-values using **resampling**.

## How to deal with more than one hypothesis test

In this chapter we focus on hypothesis testing to make inference.
```{r 13-01,echo=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)

DiagrammeR::mermaid(
  "graph TB
A((estimation))
 B((prediction))
C((hypothesis testing))-->D(inference)
  "
,height = '100%', width = '100%')
```

When making a hypothesis testing, the steps are:

```{r 13-02,echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
DiagrammeR::mermaid(
  "graph LR
A[1.Null hypothesis H0]

C[2.P-value]-->D(to quantify the results of a Hp testing)

B[3.T-statistic]
  "
,height = '100%', width = '100%')
```

In general, we have two hypotheses $H_{0}$ and $H_{a}$:

$$H_{0}:\text{the mean in the control group equals the mean in the treatment group}$$
$$H_{0}:\mu_{t}=\mu_{c}$$
and 

$$H_{a}:\text{mean values are not equal}$$


Now we want to **test some particular set of null hypotheses**:

$$\text{m are the number of hypotheses we make}$$

$$H_{01},...,H_{0m}$$ 

$H_{0j}$ is the mean value of the $j^{th}$ value

Multiple testing lead to the **False discovery rate** (1990) 

```{r 13-03,echo=FALSE}
DiagrammeR::mermaid(
  "graph LR
A(Multiple testing)-->B(False discovery rate - FDR)
  "
,height = '100%', width = '100%')
```


## Hypothesis testing steps

1.  Define a hypothesis
2.  Make a test statistic
3.  compute a p-value (to quantify the prob of having a value which is equal or more extreme than the t-test result)
4.  decide if to reject $H_0$


**Step 1** is what we decide based on our investigation.

**Step 2** is to construct a t-statistic, it summarize the relation with $H_0$.

if: $$H_{0}:\mu_{t}=\mu_{c}$$ we have a **two sample test** as we are searching values on the left and on the right of the t-test results
$$T=\frac{\mu_{t}-\mu_{c}}{s\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_t}+\frac{1}{n_c}}}$$
$$s=\sqrt{\frac{(n_{t}-1)s_{t}^2+(n_{t}-1)s_{c}^2}{n_{t}+n_{c}-2}}$$
A *large* absolute value of the T-statistic is against the $H_0$.

```{r 13-04, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/13_01.png")
```


**Step 3** is to compute a **p-value**, the probability of observing a value which is equal or more extreme than the observed value.

**P-value is observing a T-stat which is equal or more extreme than the observed statistic**

The p-value let's us interpret the scale of out t-statistic absolute result.

The t-stat value is arbitrarily "LARGE", the p-value rescale it to (0 to 1), in terms of probability to find an equal or more extreme value.

**Step 4** is to identify if to reject $H_0$ or fail to reject $H_0$.
The smaller the p-value is the stronger is the evidence AGAINST the NULL hypothesis.


```{r 13-05, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/13_02.png")
```

- **Type I error** reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is TRUE
- **Type I error Rate** is the prob of type I error
- **Type II error** no reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is FALSE
- **POWER** of hypothesis is the prob of not making type II error

**There is a trade-off between type I & type II error**

## m NULL hypotheses

$$H_{01},...,H_{0m}$$ 

If we reject all NULL hypotheses with p-value < 0.01

**How many type I error are to expect?**

**Example**

1.  $p-value < \alpha$ with $\alpha=0.01$

there is $1%$ chance to FALSE reject $H_0$ (if $H_0$ is TRUE)

2.  $\text{m NULL hypotheses}$

there is $1%$ chance of rejecting single $H_0$, and $\text{m x }0.01$ FALSE rejections in total.

---


## Family Wise Error Rate (FWER)

Probability of making at least 1 type I error.


```{r 13-06, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/13_03.png")
```



**FWER is the probability of at least 1 type I error**

$$FWER =Pr(V\geq1)=$$
$$=1-Pr(V=0)=$$
$$=1-\prod_{1}^{m}{(1-\alpha)}=$$
$$1-(1-\alpha)^m$$

With hypothesis that **m** tests are independents.

---

### Controlling FWER

1.  **Bonferroni correction**

$$FWER\leq m\frac{\alpha}{m}=\alpha$$
We set a new $\alpha$ value which is lower in proportion.

**Bonferroni** $\frac{\alpha}{m}=\text{new } \alpha$


2.  **Holm's step down**
**Holm's** $L=min{j:p_j>\frac{\alpha}{m+1-j}}$ is less conservative, with fewer type II errors and greater **power**.

$$\text{min }\{p_j>\frac{\alpha}{m+1-j}\}$$


These other two are subsequent methods to apply for further investigations:

3.  **Tukey's method**

4.  **Scheffè's method**


---

## Power

*Power* is the number of FALSE $H_0$ rejected/total FALSE $H_0$

$$\frac{S}{(m-m_0)}$$


When **m** increases **power** decreases.

---


## False Discovery Rate (FDR)

Other than **FWER** which is too stringent, there is **FDR**.

$$FDR=\frac{V}{V+S}=\frac{V}{R}$$

The **False Discovery Proportion (FDP)** can be used as a threshold:
$$FDP = \frac{V}{R}$$
$$FDR=E(FDP)=E(\frac{V}{R})$$
---


## Benjamini-Hochberg procedure

This procedure is to control **FDP** deciding which $H_0$ to reject while $FDR\approx{E(\frac{V}{R})}$


$$FDR={E(\frac{V}{R})}<q$$

Less than $q$, a specific value to use in the algorithm:

ordered p-values: $p_1<p_2<...<p_m$

$$L=max\{j:p_{j}<\frac{qj}{m}\}$$
reject $h_{0j}:p_{j}\leq{p_{(L)}}$


In conclusion, on average no more than a fraction of $q$ of rejected $H_0$ are FALSE POSITIVE.

This is an example of how to make **multiple hypothesis test** in Genomics.

## Load libraries and datasets
```{r chunk29, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rafalib)
```
```{r chunk29hide, eval = FALSE}
# BiocManager::install(c("genefilter", "qvalue"))
library(genefilter) # rowttests function
library(qvalue) # to calculate a qvalue and compare with p.adjust(...method="fdr")
```

```{r chunk29a, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# install_github("genomicsclass/GSE5859Subset")
# library(GSE5859Subset)
# data(GSE5859Subset)
# saveRDS(geneExpression,"data/13_geneExpression.rds")
# saveRDS(sampleInfo,"data/13_sampleInfo.rds")
```


```{r chunk29c, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
geneExpression <- readRDS("data/13_geneExpression.rds")
sampleInfo<- readRDS("data/13_sampleInfo.rds")
```


## Multiple T-test

For calculating the t-test for all the genes in the **geneExpression** matrix, we use the `rowttests()` function from the {genefilter} package.
```{r chunk30, eval=FALSE, include=T}
?rowttests
```
We define the **NULL Hypothesis** with a vector of the same length of the unique elements in the dataset.
If our dataset is made of m unique elements and m0 are the number of positives, we can build a binary vector to use in the calculation of the pvalues.

Here is an example on how to make a nullHypothesis vector.
```{r chunk31, eval=FALSE, include=T}
nullHypothesis <- c(rep(TRUE,m0), rep(FALSE,m-m0))
null_hypothesis <- factor(nullHypothesis, levels=c("TRUE","FALSE"))
```

In our case study we use the **geneExpression** matrix with genes expression data and the **sampleInfo** for retrieving the groups of positives and negatives within the dataset.
```{r chunk32}
null_hypothesis <- factor(sampleInfo$group)
```

Have a look a the dimentsion of the geneExpression matrix:
```{r chunk33}
dim(geneExpression)
```

```{r chunk34}
geneExpression%>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column("gene") %>%
  count(gene,sort=T)%>%
  head
```

Statistics, difference in mean and p.value:
```{r chunk35, eval = FALSE}
results <- rowttests(geneExpression,null_hypothesis)
results2 <- rowttests(geneExpression,factor(rep("a","b",24)))
results%>%head;results2%>%head
```
```{r chunk35b, echo = FALSE}
# saveRDS(results, "data/13_results35.rds")
# saveRDS(results2, "data/13_results35_2.rds")
results <- readRDS("data/13_results35.rds")
results2 <- readRDS("data/13_results35_2.rds")

results%>%head;results2%>%head
```

The results is 1383 genes have a pvalue lower than 5%
```{r chunk36, eval = FALSE}
results <- rowttests(geneExpression,null_hypothesis)
sum(results$p.value<0.05)
```
```{r chunk36b, echo = FALSE}
# saveRDS(results, "data/13_results36.rds")
results <- readRDS("data/13_results36.rds")
```
```{r chunk37}
mean(results$p.value<0.05)
```

### FWER Family Wise Error Rate

What is the **probability to make at least 1 type I error**?

First consider the nuber of hypothesis which is the number of genes in our case:
```{r chunk38}
m <- length(results$p.value) 
m
```

Then calculate the FWER:
```{r chunk39}
1-(1-0.05)^m
```

So, the probability to make at least one type I error is 1! 
if we set $\alpha$:
$$P(\text{at least one rejection})=1−(1−k)^m=5\%$$
$$k=1-0.95^{\frac{1}{m}}\approx 0.000005$$

```{r chunk40}
1-0.95^(1/m)
```
What we need to do next is to adjust this FWER to a suitable threshold applying some corrections, such as the **Bonferroni** correction procedure sets $k=\alpha/m$:
```{r chunk41}
1-(1-0.05/m)^m
```

```{r chunk42}
0.05/m
```




```{r chunk43}
sum(results$p.value<0.05/m)
```

Now, the number of hypothesis with a pvalue lower than 5% are 10 and the FWER adjusted is:
```{r chunk44}
mean(results$p.value<0.05/m)
```

### FDR False discovery rate

This is referred to as a **discovery driven project or experiment**, as we are now going to adjust the threshold to a lower value than $\alpha$ through experiment just as the same as we have demonstrated above.


>"The idea behind FDR is to focus on the random variable Q≡V/R with Q=0 when R=0 and V=0. Note that R=0 (nothing called significant) implies V=0 (no false positives). So Q is a random variable that can take values between 0 and 1 and we can define a rate by considering the average of Q. To better understand this concept here, we compute Q for the procedure: call everything p-value < 0.05 significant."

Compare the FDR results for two methods.

1.  First method: using `p.adjust()` function from {stats} package
```{r chunk45}
pvals = results$p.value
pvals<-sort(pvals)

# to find a q-value with the false discovery rate method
fdr <- p.adjust(pvals, method="fdr")

sum(fdr<0.05)
```


```{r chunk46}
mean(fdr<0.05)
```

2.  Second method: using the `qvalue()` function from {qvalue} package
```{r chunk47, eval = FALSE}
res <- qvalue::qvalue(pvals)
```
```{r chunk47b, echo = FALSE}
# saveRDS(res, "data/13_res47.rds")
res <- readRDS("data/13_res47.rds")
```
```{r chunk47c}
qvals <- res$qvalues
#plot(pvals,qvals)
sum(qvals<0.05)
```


```{r chunk48}
mean(qvals<0.05)
```

The proportion of true null hypotheses:
```{r chunk49}
res$pi0
```


```{r chunk51, eval = FALSE}
hist(pvals,breaks=seq(0,1,len=21))
expectedfreq <- length(pvals)/20 #per bin
abline(h=expectedfreq*qvalue(pvals)$pi0,col=2,lty=2)
```
```{r chunk51b, echo = FALSE}
hist(pvals,breaks=seq(0,1,len=21))
expectedfreq <- length(pvals)/20 #per bin
# h <- expectedfreq*qvalue::qvalue(pvals)$pi0
# saveRDS(h, "data/13_h51.rds")
h <- readRDS("data/13_h51.rds")
abline(h=h,col=2,lty=2)
```


## Replications

Little recap: **There is a trade-off between type I & type II error**

- **Type I error** reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is TRUE
- **Type I error Rate** is the prob of type I error
- **Type II error** no reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is FALSE
- **POWER** of hypothesis is the prob of not making type II error



![](images/13_03.png){width=80%}

- R: sum of the number of pvalues which are below the threshold and will be rejected (n. rejections)
- m: total hypothesis testing
- m0: negatives
- m1: m-m0 positives

Now what we do is replicating the sample in a lab environment to obtain fake data, in order to do that we generate a matrix from a replication of normal distribution of the same size of our data.

```{r fake}
n <- 24
m <- 8793
delta <- 2 # this is the sample split in two
positives <- 500 # m1
# negatives
m0<- m-positives # 8293

mat <- matrix(rnorm(n*m),m,n)
mat[1:positives,1:(n/2)] <- mat[1:positives,1:(n/2)] + delta
```


Then we do 1000 replications to see in what is the false discovery rate for this lab.
```{r fake2, eval=FALSE, include=T}
B<-1000
set.seed(1173)
results_global <- replicate(B,{
  mat <- matrix(rnorm(n*m),m,n)
  mat[1:positives,1:(n/2)] <- mat[1:positives,1:(n/2)] + delta
  pvals = genefilter::rowttests(mat,null_hypothesis)$p.val
  ##Bonferroni
  FP1 <- sum(pvals[-(1:positives)]<=0.05/m)  
  FN1 <- sum(pvals[1:positives]>0.05/m)
  # p.adjust
  qvals1 <- p.adjust(pvals,method = "fdr")
  FP2<-sum(qvals1[-(1:positives)]<=0.05)
  FN2 <- sum(qvals1[1:positives]>0.05)
  # qvalue
  qvals2 <- qvalue::qvalue(pvals)$qvalues
  FP3<-sum(qvals2[-(1:positives)]<=0.05)
  FN3 <- sum(qvals2[1:positives]>0.05)
  c(FP1,FN1,FP2,FN2,FP3,FN3)
}) 

```

```{r saverds,eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# saveRDS(results_global,"data/13_results_global.rds")
# rm(results_global)
```

```{r readrds,include=FALSE}
results_global<-readRDS("data/13_results_global.rds")
```

```{r chunk52}
class(results_global)
```

In this table are summarised the: false positives (FP) and the false negatives (FN) for three methods:

- Bonferroni
- FDR with p.adjust()
- FDR with qvalue()

The counts for FP and FN for the three cases:
```{r results_global, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
results_global2<-results_global%>%
  as_tibble()%>%
  mutate(id=c("FP1","FN1","FP2-padjust","FN2-padjust","FP3-qvalue","FN3-qvalue"))%>%
  relocate(id)%>%
  column_to_rownames("id")
results_global2%>%select(1:6)
```

The mean values or the proportions for the same methods:
```{r chunk53, echo=FALSE}
data.frame(
  id=c("FP","FN"),
  "Bonferroni"=c(mean(results_global[1,]/m0),mean(results_global[2,]/positives)),
  "FDR - padjust"=c(mean(results_global[3,]/m0),mean(results_global[4,]/positives)),
  "FDR - qvalue"=c(mean(results_global[5,]/m0),mean(results_global[6,]/positives))
)
```

```

## Lab: Multiple Testing

**Review of Hypothesis Tests**

We begin by performing some one-sample  $t$-tests  using the `t.test()` function.

First we create 100 variables, each consisting of 10 observations. The first 50 variables have mean $0.5$ and variance $1$, while the others have mean $0$ and variance $1$.

```{r chunk1}
set.seed(6)
x <- matrix(rnorm(10 * 100), 10, 100)
x[, 1:50] <- x[, 1:50] + 0.5
```

Calculate the t-test.
```{r chunk2}
t.test(x[, 1], mu = 0)
```

And with a `for` we calculate the t-tests and the pvalues:
```{r chunk3}
p.values <- rep(0, 100)

for (i in 1:100)
  p.values[i] <- t.test(x[, i], mu = 0)$p.value

decision <- rep("Do not reject H0", 100)
decision[p.values <= .05] <- "Reject H0"
```


```{r chunk4}
table(decision,
    c(rep("H0 is False", 50), rep("H0 is True", 50))
  )
```

Repeate the t-test:

```{r chunk5}
x <- matrix(rnorm(10 * 100), 10, 100)
x[, 1:50] <- x[, 1:50] + 1

for (i in 1:100)
  p.values[i] <- t.test(x[, i], mu = 0)$p.value


decision <- rep("Do not reject H0", 100)
decision[p.values <= .05] <- "Reject H0"


table(decision,
    c(rep("H0 is False", 50), rep("H0 is True", 50))
  )
```


## The Family-Wise Error Rate

If the null hypothesis is true for each of $m$ independent hypothesis tests, then the FWER is equal to $1-(1-\alpha)^m$. 

We can use this expression to compute the FWER for $m=1,\ldots, 500$ and $\alpha=0.05$, $0.01$, and $0.001$.

```{r chunk6}
m <- 1:500
fwe1 <- 1 - (1 - 0.05)^m
fwe2 <- 1 - (1 - 0.01)^m
fwe3 <- 1 - (1 - 0.001)^m
```


We now conduct a one-sample $t$-test for each of the first five managers in the `Fund` dataset, in order to test the null hypothesis that the $j$th fund manager's mean return equals zero, $H_{0j}: \mu_j=0$.

```{r chunk8}
library(ISLR2)
fund.mini <- Fund[, 1:5]

t.test(fund.mini[, 1], mu = 0)

fund.pvalue <- rep(0, 5)


for (i in 1:5)
  fund.pvalue[i] <- t.test(fund.mini[, i], mu = 0)$p.value

fund.pvalue
```

We will make a correction with Bonferroni's method and Holm's method to control the FWER.


To do this, we use the `p.adjust()` function. 


In other words, the adjusted $p$-values resulting from the `p.adjust()` function can be compared to the desired FWER in order to determine whether or not to reject each hypothesis.


```{r chunk9}
p.adjust(fund.pvalue, method = "bonferroni")
pmin(fund.pvalue * 5, 1)
```

Therefore, using Bonferroni's method, we are able to reject the null hypothesis only for Manager One while controlling the FWER at $0.05$.

By contrast, using Holm's method, the adjusted $p$-values indicate that we can reject the null hypotheses for Managers One and Three at a FWER of $0.05$.

```{r chunk10}
p.adjust(fund.pvalue, method = "holm")
```

Manager One performs well, whereas Manager Two has poor performance.

```{r chunk11}
apply(fund.mini, 2, mean)
```


```{r chunk12}
t.test(fund.mini[, 1], fund.mini[, 2], paired = T)
```

Here, we use the `TukeyHSD()` function to apply Tukey's methodin order to adjust for multiple testing.

```{r chunk13}
conflicted::conflict_prefer("as.matrix", "base")
returns <- as.vector(base::as.matrix(fund.mini))
manager <- rep(c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5"), rep(50, 5))
a1 <- aov(returns ~ manager)
TukeyHSD(x = a1)
```


```{r chunk13a}
mean(TukeyHSD(x = a1)$manager[,4])

```

The `TukeyHSD()` function provides confidence intervals for the difference between each pair of managers (`lwr` and `upr`), as well as a $p$-value. 


All of these quantities have been adjusted for multiple testing. 

Let's plot the confidence intervals for the pairwise comparisons using the `plot()` function.

```{r chunk14}
plot(TukeyHSD(x = a1))
```

---

## The False Discovery Rate

Now we perform hypothesis tests for all 2,000 fund managers in the `Fund` dataset. 


With one-sample $t$-test of $H_{0j}: \mu_j=0$, which states that the $j$th fund manager's mean return is zero.

```{r chunk15}
fund.pvalues <- rep(0, 2000)
for (i in 1:2000)
  fund.pvalues[i] <- t.test(Fund[, i], mu = 0)$p.value
```

The `p.adjust()` function can be used with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

```{r chunk16}
q.values.BH <- p.adjust(fund.pvalues, method = "BH")
q.values.BH[1:10]
```

The q-values output by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure can be interpreted as the smallest FDR threshold.

> How many of the fund managers can we reject $H_{0j}: \mu_j=0$?

```{r chunk17}
sum(q.values.BH <= .1)
```

What if we had instead used Bonferroni's method to control the FWER at level  $\alpha=0.1$?

```{r chunk18}
sum(fund.pvalues <= (0.1 / 2000))
```

Finally, `wh` indexes all  $p$-values that are less than or equal to the largest $p$-value in `wh.ps`. Therefore, `wh`indexes the $p$-values rejected by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

```{r chunk19}
ps <- sort(fund.pvalues)
m <- length(fund.pvalues)
q <- 0.1
wh.ps <- which(ps < q * (1:m) / m)
if (length(wh.ps) >0) {
  wh <- 1:max(wh.ps)
 } else {
  wh <- numeric(0)
 }
```



```{r chunk20}
plot(ps, log = "xy", ylim = c(4e-6, 1), ylab = "P-Value",
    xlab = "Index", main = "")
points(wh, ps[wh], col = 4)
abline(a = 0, b = (q / m), col = 2, untf = TRUE)
abline(h = 0.1 / 2000, col = 3)
```

---

## A Re-Sampling Approach

Re-sampling approach to hypothesis testing using the `Khan` dataset.

```{r chunk21}
attach(Khan)
x <- rbind(xtrain, xtest)
y <- c(as.numeric(ytrain), as.numeric(ytest))
dim(x)
table(y)
```

There are four classes of cancer. 

For each gene, we compare the mean expression in the second class (rhabdomyosarcoma) to the mean expression in the fourth class (Burkitt's lymphoma).

```{r chunk22}
x <- as.matrix(x)
x1 <- x[which(y == 2), ]
x2 <- x[which(y == 4), ]
n1 <- nrow(x1)
n2 <- nrow(x2)
t.out <- t.test(x1[, 11], x2[, 11], var.equal = TRUE)
TT <- t.out$statistic
TT
t.out$p.value
```


Instead of using this theoretical null distribution, we can randomly split the 54 patients into two groups of 29 and 25, and compute a new test statistic.

Repeating this process 10,000 times:
```{r chunk23}
set.seed(1)
B <- 10000
Tbs <- rep(NA, B)
for (b in 1:B) {
   dat <- sample(c(x1[, 11], x2[, 11]))
   Tbs[b] <- t.test(dat[1:n1], dat[(n1 + 1):(n1 + n2)],
        var.equal = TRUE
      )$statistic
}
mean((abs(Tbs) >= abs(TT)))
```

This fraction, $0.0416$, is our re-sampling-based $p$-value. It is almost identical to the $p$-value of $0.0412$ obtained using the theoretical null distribution.

A histogram of the re-sampling-based test statistics:

```{r chunk24}
hist(Tbs, breaks = 100, xlim = c(-4.2, 4.2), main = "",
    xlab = "Null Distribution of Test Statistic", col = 7)
lines(seq(-4.2, 4.2, len = 1000),
    dt(seq(-4.2, 4.2, len = 1000),
      df = (n1 + n2 - 2)
    ) * 1000, col = 2, lwd = 3)
abline(v = TT, col = 4, lwd = 2)
text(TT + 0.5, 350, paste("T = ", round(TT, 4), sep = ""),
    col = 4)
```


For each gene, we first compute the observed test statistic,

```{r chunk25}
m <- 100
B<-1000
set.seed(1)
index <- sample(ncol(x1), m)
Ts <- rep(NA, m)
Ts.star <- matrix(NA, ncol = m, nrow = B)
for (j in 1:m) {
  k <- index[j]
  Ts[j] <- t.test(x1[, k], x2[, k],
        var.equal = TRUE
      )$statistic
  for (b in 1:B) {
    dat <- sample(c(x1[, k], x2[, k]))
    Ts.star[b, j] <- t.test(dat[1:n1],
         dat[(n1 + 1):(n1 + n2)], var.equal = TRUE
       )$statistic
  }
}
```

Compute a number of rejected null hypotheses $R$.

```{r chunk26}
cs <- sort(abs(Ts))
FDRs <- Rs <- Vs <- rep(NA, m)
for (j in 1:m) {
  R <- sum(abs(Ts) >= cs[j])
  V <- sum(abs(Ts.star) >= cs[j]) / B
  Rs[j] <- R
  Vs[j] <- V
  FDRs[j] <- V / R
}
```


The variable `index` is needed here since we restricted our analysis to just $100$ randomly-selected genes.

```{r chunk27}
max(Rs[FDRs <= .1])
sort(index[abs(Ts) >= min(cs[FDRs < .1])])
max(Rs[FDRs <= .2])
sort(index[abs(Ts) >= min(cs[FDRs < .2])])
```



```{r chunk28}
plot(Rs, FDRs, xlab = "Number of Rejections", type = "l",
    ylab = "False Discovery Rate", col = 4, lwd = 3)
```

00:53:00	Ron:	FROM "Regression and Other Stories": 

The three challenges of statistical inference are:
1. Generalizing from sample to population, a problem that is associated with survey sampling but
actually arises in nearly every application of statistical inference;


2. Generalizing from treatment to control group, a problem that is associated with causal inference,
which is implicitly or explicitly part of the interpretation of most regressions we have seen; and

3. Generalizing from observed measurements to the underlying constructs of interest, as most of the
time our data do not record exactly what we would ideally like to study.
