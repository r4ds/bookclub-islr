# Tree-Based Methods

**Learning objectives:**

- Use **basic decision trees** to model relationships between predictors and an outcome.
- Compare and contrast tree-based models with other model types.
- Use **tree-based ensemble methods** to build predictive models.
- Compare and contrast the various methods of building tree ensembles: bagging, boosting, random forests, and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees.

## Slide 1

- Try to follow a slide-like format.

## Slide 2

- Use `##` to create new slides (sections).
